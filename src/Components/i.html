                This initial step is meant to help decide if we’re a good fit
                for your project. This includes assessing tech feasibility, your
                team’s goals, budget, and timeline, and aligning expectations so
                that we can together decide whether to proceed.
              </p>
              <p>
                You begin by booking a call with an Airdev account executive to
                discuss your project and our approach. They will understand your
                team, what you are trying to do, and the most critical product
                requirements to get there. From this call they will write out a
                summary for our product team, which will review and confirm
                technical feasibility and budget/timeline alignment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result of this step is a high-level written proposal for the
                build: the features we would build, expected budget, and
                stages/timeline to get to launch. While the exact details will
                be confirmed during the formal scoping process, our aim at this
                step is to give you the information you need to have confidence
                that this is the right path for you. When you’re ready, you’ll
                put down a refundable deposit to reserve time with your PM for
                scoping.

                The goal of the scoping step is to align on the exact features
                and architecture for your app. Taking the time to define
                everything upfront helps us to move quickly during the build,
                and ensures that you get what you are expecting.
              </p>
              <p>
                We start by matching you with a Product Manager (PM) from our
                team who we believe will best serve your needs. During your
                calls with the PM, you’ll walk through the entire app flow,
                stopping at critical points to decide what to include vs. push
                for later, and the best ways to solve for the requirements
                within budget. We typically anchor on the leanest approach, and
                let you push to add features as needed. Our team will perform
                technical research and document all requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result of this step is a detailed scope document that
                outlines the exact users, pages, and features your initial
                product will include, as well as a timeline and budget for the
                build. By this point you will have clarity on how your vision
                translates into a specific product.

                With feature requirements in place, the final step to the
                pre-build process is to add high fidelity mockups that define
                what users will see as they interact with your product. This is
                where the UX designer comes in.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using the written feature descriptions from the scoping doc, the
                UX designer creates a full set of custom Figma mockups for your
                app, using our<a href="https://build.airdev.co/">
                  Canvas design framework</a
                >
                with your company&#x27;s branding. This means you’ll get designs
                that are (1) custom to your features, (2) follow best practices
                and standard UX conventions, and (3) fit our build process so
                they can be assembled efficiently.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once all pictures and words are combined, you have the entire
                scope doc that will serve as the blueprint for your build. You
                can submit any detailed feedback within this doc, and your PM
                can make adjustments as needed (including corresponding
                budget/timeline updates) until you are comfortable with the
                plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some clients prefer to use their own custom designs, which can
                add a significant amount to build cost and timeline, so large
                majority of our clients opt for Canvas and consider a redesign

                With the detailed build plan in hand, the focus shifts to your
                Airdev build team, which builds and tests the complete
                application in weekly milestones.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your PM will manage a team consisting of a lead developer, UI
                assembler, and QA specialist. Each week, the team builds and
                tests the features we have designated for that milestone, and
                delivers the working app along with testing instructions so you
                can confirm everything is working as expected. Your PM will hold
                a live delivery call with you to make sure we’re aligned and
                ready to proceed with the following milestone.
              </p>
              <p>
                This stage ends when a full version of your app — with all
                features internally tested by Airdev — is ready for your final
                review before launch!

                Even the most basic software products have complexity under the
                hood, and can take some time to fully test and confirm. For
                every build, we provide a 30-day window of coverage from our
                team to confirm, launch, and support the application.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we turn the app over to you, our internal team has finished
                our QA process, so the first step is for you to thoroughly
                review every aspect of the tool and flag anything that is not
                built according to the confirmed scope. We have a nifty widget
                so you can mark up the app itself to create tickets, which we
                clarify and resolve.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you&#x27;re ready to go live, we deploy your app on your
                custom domain and transfer all credentials and IP rights you.
                Celebrations and AirHugs for everyone! Any remaining time in the
                30-day window is extra support just in case you spot anything
                that slipped through the cracks.

                As you approach the end of your “review and launch” period, your
                Client Success manager will contact you to chat about what comes
                next. For most clients, launch is just the beginning since app
                generally must evolve in response to user feedback.
              </p>
              <p>
                We offer two forms of post-launch support: (1) one-time capacity
                to build discrete features, and (2) ongoing monthly capacity to
                maintain and build features over time from the roadmap. The
                former is typically best for early-stage clients on a budget,
                and the latter is best for more mature clients with a robust
                roadmap and need for constant support.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, we recognize that your journey and needs can be
                unpredictable. Our goal is to give you control of when and how
                you use your Airdev team to get there.
